# hans-element

This is my standard boilerplate I use for web components. I created it because I couldn't find this written down anywhere. It provides react-like fuss with none of the muss! It is as simple as possible and has nothing fancy in it. 

For convenience and instruction I have included an index.html file that uses the component.
